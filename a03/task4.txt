not interchangeable:
- to use this general approach for BRDFs, we would need to sample the BRDF in order to generate a distribution,
just to sample this distribution again -> expensive
-> use analytical method when function is known and a pdf for it can be computed

- cannot do analytical inversion for environment maps (unless environment map is generated from a function)
-> we need to use the inversion approach implemented in this exercise (textures are already discretized anyways)
-> use general inversion method when function is unkown, but discretized function values are given
